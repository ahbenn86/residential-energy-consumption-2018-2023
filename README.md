## Introduction

The data for this analysis was obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). A filtered subset of the data (Table_02_01a) was used to focus specifically on the primary energy consumed by the residential sector from 2018 to 2023. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to remove missing values, reformat columns, and separate data as needed. During the EDA, an anomaly was discovered: residential energy consumption decreased during the years when most of the U.S. population was ordered to stay home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Bar Graph

After experimenting with different graph types, I concluded that a simple bar graph would best convey the information.
